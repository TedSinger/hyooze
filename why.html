        <h1>Basic Ergonomic Colors</h1>

        Here is a palette of colors in columns of equal brightness, with a
        variety of chromas and hues:
        <br><br>
        <aside style="display: none;">Each of these four images shows colors
            arranged in columns by brightness, and placed vertically by hue. The
            result looks haphazard because of empty sections and because the
            hues do not align to any grid. Each image has the darker colors on a
            white background and the lighter colors on a black background</aside>
        <div style="display: block;">
            <!-- FIXME: tooltips were lost!-->
            <img src="grey-palette.svg" alt="10 greys">
            <br>
            <img src="subtle-palette.svg" alt="35 pastel colors">
            <br>
            <img src="muted-palette.svg" alt="34 muted colors">
            <br>
            <img src="loud-palette.svg" alt="34 saturated colors">
        </div>
        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        Color brightness controls the legibility of text. But it is difficult to
        calculate. Mistakes result in illegible text, and make reading
        inaccurate, uncomfortable, and slow.
        <br><br>
        With this palette, an application designer can change colors for other
        concerns without risking a loss of legibility.

            <summary>What else is color useful for?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li> Building an <a
                        href=https://colorusage.arc.nasa.gov/Percept_layers_1.php>attention

                <li> Conveying semantic meaning</li>
                <li> Adding boundary hints (zebra striping, syntax

            </ul>
        </details>


        <h2>Why is brightness hard to compute?</h2>
        Most computer monitors have a red, a green, and a blue rectangular
        subpixel in each square pixel. Each of these can be activated to any
        level from 0 through 255. The RGB colorspace corresponds to this
        mechanical detail. A hexadecimal color code like #0080FF represents zero
        activation of red, 128 (from the 80 in hexadecimal) activation of green,
        and 255 (from the FF in hexadecimal) activation of blue. While
        convenient for the computer, this colorspace doesn't correspond to
        any aspect of human perception.
        <br><br>

        <text style="font-weight: bold; background-color: #00FF00; color:
            #0000FF;">
            Lime (#00FF00) is much brighter than Blue (#0000FF)
        </text>
        , which is surprising from the hexcodes in isolation. We are not
        interested in physical intensity of light, but in brightness as a
        "perceptual correlate". Perceptual correlates are derived from
        experimental data (participants are asked to judge which of two colors
        is brighter, for example). Color scientists write as clear models as
        they can to fit the data, but the underlying system is biological and
        variable. The resulting math is opaque, at best.
        <h2>What can we do?</h2>
        Fortunately, the hard work implementing this math has already been done
        by a library <a
            href=https://python-colormath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>python-colormath</a>*.
        Using that, we can convert the RGB color gamut into a perceptually
        uniform space**. From there, we just have to translate what we want into
        mathematical constraints.
        <br><br>
        We want large and predictable contrast ratios***. Our colors will be on
        contours of equal brightness, which are spaced evenly on a logarithmic
        scale. This way, the constrast ratio of any two colors in our palette is
        set by the number of brightness contours between them. Each of these
        should be equally readable:
        <ul>
            <li>5-blue on 10-yellow</li>
            <li>3-grey on 8-tan</li>
            <li>1-green on 6-pink</li>
        </ul>
        We want a broad palette of chromas and hues. Within each brightness
        contour, our colors should be spaced out with many saturated colors and
        some unsaturated colors. To do this, we convert to a metric space, and
        select points minimizing an imaginary energy field.
