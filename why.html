<h1>Basic Ergonomic Colors</h1>

Here is a palette of colors in groups of equal brightness, with a variety of chromas and hues:

<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
Brightness is the only aspect of color that affects the legibility of text, but it is difficult to calculate. With this palette, an application designer can change colors for other concerns without risking a loss of legibility. Poor legibility causes reading to be inaccurate, uncomfortable, and slow. Casual users will become frustrated and give up. Dedicated users will perservere, but make avoidable mistakes.

<h2>Why is brightness hard to compute?</h2>
Most computer monitors have a red, a green, and a blue rectangular subpixel in each square pixel. Each of these can be activated to any level from 0 through 255. The RGB colorspace corresponds to this mechanical detail. A hexadecimal color code like #0080FF represents zero activation of red, 128 (from the 80 in hexadecimal) activation of green, and 255 (from the FF in hexadecimal) activation of blue.

While useful for the computer, this colorspace doesn't correspond to any aspect of human perception.

, which is surprising from the hexcodes in isolation. We are not interested in physical intensity of light, but in brightness as a "perceptual correlate". Perceptual correlates are derived from experimental data (participants are asked to judge which of two colors are brighter or which is more muted, for example). Color scientists write as clear and intuitive models as they can to fit the data, but the underlying system is biological and variable. The resulting math is opaque, at best.

Fortunately, the hard work has already been done by a library <a href=https://python-colormath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>python-colormath</a>*. Using that, we can convert the RGB color gamut into a perceptually uniform space**. From there, we have a straightforward optimization problem.

We want large and predictable contrast ratios***. Our colors will be on contours of equal brightness, which are spaced evenly on a logarithmic scale. This way, the constrast ratio of any two colors in our palette is the number of brightness contours between them.

We want a broad palette of chromas and hues. Within each brightness contour, our colors should be spaced out with many saturated colors and some muted colors.

*** Contrast ratio measures the change in brightness between foreground and background, determining how legible a pair of colors is.
